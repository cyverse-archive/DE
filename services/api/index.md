## Discovery Environment API (Terrain)

Terrain provides the primary point of communication between the Discovery Environment (DE) UI and backend services. It's charged with two primary tasks: to handle authentication and authorization for endpoints that require it, and to orchestrate calls to other lower-level services.

### Authentication

Authentication to the DE services is currently handled by passing signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in the custom HTTP header, `X-Iplant-De-Jwt`, in each call to the service. The JWT payload used by the DE is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "sub": "username",
    "email": "username@example.org",
    "given_name": "Joe",
    "family_name": "User",
    "name": "Joe User",
    "org.iplantc.de:entitlement": [
        "some-group",
        "some-other-group",
        "yet-another-group"
    ]
}
```

The DE doesn't currently support the `name` field, but there are plans to add support for this field in an upcoming release. The rest of the field values are obtained indirectly from LDAP via CAS. The fields are (or will be in the case of the `name` field) obtained as follows:

| JWT Claim (Field)          | LDAP Attribute    | CAS Attribute |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| sub                        | uid               | uid           |
| email                      | mail              | email         |
| given_name                 | givenName         | firstName     |
| family_name                | sn                | lastName      |
| name                       | cn                | name          |
| org.iplantc.de:entitlement | _aggregate field_ | entitlement   |

<br>The `entitlement` attribute is aggregated from LDAP by placing the name of each group that the user belongs to into an array. The list is obtained by extracting the `cn` attribute of every LDAP group that has the username of the authenticated user as one of its `memberUid` field values.

The JWT is then signed and encoded according to [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) and [RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515). Note that the only signing algorithm currently supported by Terrain is `RS256`. For more information, please see [jwt.io](http://jwt.io/).

For information on development testing, please see the [documentation for make-jwt](/tools/make-jwt).
