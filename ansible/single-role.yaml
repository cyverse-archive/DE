# This playbook is used to execute "one-to-one" playbooks in the `playbooks` dir.
#
# "one-to-one" refers to playbooks which only execute one role, and are named
# to indicate that role. This is suggested in ansible's best practices[1].
#
# To use this playbook, ansible's roles path must be configured to include the
# `roles/` directory. This can be achieved either by the ansible cfg file, 
# or using the `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` environment variable.
#
# EXAMPLE
# =======
# To execute the `de-docker-network` one-to-one playbook;
#
#     ansible-playbook single-role.yaml -K --extra-vars "playbook=playbooks/de-docker-network.yml"
